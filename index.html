                This article talks about how Meta's Metaverse technology is failing at what it is supposed to be.She agrees that the core concept of Metaverse is indeed a good one and if implemented properly could provide a great asset for Meta. She states that the current version of the Metaverse is nothing but an extended or deeper version of Zoom. The main purpose of Metaverse should instead be to provide a space for creation if it is not intended for gamers.
